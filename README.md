# Minigames
The gamemode content for Fluffy Servers - Minigames (a community server for Garry's Mod).
This repo was developed in November 2017 and opened publically in April 2018.

## What this contains
* The base gamemode for the minigames system
* The completed and functional gamemodes found on the server
* Some in-development gamemodes

## What this does not contain
* A working minigames system

   Some important code is contained on a seperate addon, which is not publically released.  
   This may be fixed and implemented into this repo in the future.
* Gamemodes that did not use the fluffy_base
* The item inventory system

## List of Gamemodes
These gamemodes were (to my knowledge) not previously implemented into Garry's Mod.
Many of these gamemodes are based on concepts from other games.
### Original
+ Climb
+ Gun Game
+ Minigolf (unfinished)
+ Oddball
+ Racing (functional but not fun)
+ Sticks and Stones
### Updated from Fretta
Code is mostly original, however these gamemode concepts were created by different people for earlier versions of Garry's Mod.
+ Incoming
+ Pitfall
+ Poltergeist
+ Smash (unfinished)
+ Sniper Wars
+ Suicide Barrels
